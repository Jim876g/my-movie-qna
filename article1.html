        <h2>1. Where did Dae-su go?</h2>
        <p>Dae-su was kidnapped and kept in captivity for 15 years without knowing the reason why.</p>

        <h2>2. Who kidnapped Dae-su and why?</h2>
        <p>Dae-su was kidnapped by the brother of his sister, who had an affair with him. Dae-su accidentally discovered this secret and told his best friend, but it quickly became public knowledge at school. This caused the sister to commit suicide. In revenge, her brother kidnapped Dae-su for 15 years.</p>

        <h2>3. Why did the kidnapper release him after 15 years?</h2>
        <p>After 15 years, the kidnapper released Dae-su because his 3-year-old daughter was about to turn 18. The kidnapper had hypnotized both Dae-su and his daughter to the point that they didn't remember each other's faces. The hypnosis was designed in such a way that if they met again and acted in a particular manner, they would fall in love with each other. This actually happened, as planned by the kidnapper.</p>
